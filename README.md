# Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game Framework

---

## What is this?

This is a framework to make choose-your-own adventure games, much like [The Worst Meeting EVER](https://github.com/crocojim18/the-worst-meeting-ever). I've been making these games for a couple of years, and I've tried to make the process as universalized as possible. Every game brings new functionality to the engine, and that's only going to progress as more games are made with it.

## What does the current version do?

The framework currently can control the following elements:
+ Buttons
+ Textbox Input
+ Any content (pictures, text, etc.)
+ Background color

As time goes on, more features are sure to be added. Suggestions are welcome!

## Licensing

Creative Commons (CC BY). This is obviously meant to be a framework for any number of games, and it'd be cool, if you made something with it, to tell me. I'd love to share your stuff!
